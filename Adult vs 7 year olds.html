<h3 id="org590f9c6">How the fight would probably play out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org590f9c6">
<p>
Since we are working with the assumption that all the kids will attack you at once and have no regard for their lives, it is safe to say that you would start struggling to fight more than 10 kids at once.
</p>

<p>
It would be fairly easy to dispatch under 5 kids as you would be able to keep track of the positions of all the kids, but as this number grows to lets say 15 or 20, it would become much harder to keep track of their positions, and you would probably find your self surrounded.
</p>

<p>
It is important to keep in mind that while you are much stronger than the kids, every time you punch\kick them you also have a <b>chance</b> of breaking your hand\leg. Their bones are weaker compared to yours but punching them with full force to the skull (or any other part of the body which is deeply protected) would probably hurt your hand and even has a fair chance of breaking it.
</p>

<p>
Another thing to keep in mind is that <b>children can easily bite flesh off of a human</b>. So if these kids happen to surround you, you have probably already lost the fight. A group of kids (10+) could easily get behind you and bite your calves or hands and while they may not be able to rip it off completely, they will still inflict significant damage which would also reduce your fighting capabilities, and you would also start losing blood.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gauge your distance accurately and keep track of their positions</li>
<li>Try going for punches to the stomach</li>

<h3 id="orgc5887d6">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc5887d6">
<p>
You could probably take on 10 kids at once, but you will not emerge unharmed, and above 15 kids you stand no chance.
